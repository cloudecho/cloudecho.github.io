## 1. Foreword

I want to develop a little game. It's amazing, right? Nowadays, we have several options for developing rich clients or apps. Cross-platform is an amazing feature that every developer dreams of, I guess. Among the multiple options, flutter and react-native stand out with no doubt. I chose Flutter as I am very familiar with Java which is similar to Dart, the programming language for Flutter. 

In this article, I'll show you how to develop a 2048 game in Flutter step by step.

## 2. Introduction to 2048

2048 is a popular sliding tile puzzle game. The rule is simple: each time you can swipe left, right, up, or down; try your best to get the tile with the number 2048.

Second, set up the development environment. Refer to https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install .
